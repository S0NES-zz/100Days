# Christmas Lights

**Tier:** 1-Beginner

The ChristmasLights application relies on your development talents to create
a mesmerizing light display. Your task is to draw seven colored circles
in a row and based on a timer change the intensity of each circle. When
a circle is brightened it's predecessor returns to its normal intensity.

This simulates the effect of a string of rippling lights, similar to the ones
displayed during the Christmas Holidays.
