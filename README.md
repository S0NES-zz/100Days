# 100Days

## Purpose

100 Days - 100 Projects it's a challenge I'm going to take (and you can join too) starting today (8th march 2021) that it's meant to improve my programming skills by building projects (lots of them emoji-smiley).

Think of it as the next step if you ever participated in the #100DaysOfCode challenge.

## Rules

â€¢ create a project per day
â€¢ share your progress on Social Media (Twitter, Facebook, Linkedin, etc) using the #100Days100Projects hashtag
â€¢ a project could be: an app, a component, a website, a game, a library, etc
â€¢ you can pick what programming language and framework you like
â€¢ the project has to be done by 11:59 PM

## Rules for me

if I fail to complete the project for the day, the first people to point it out on Twitter ([@S0Soneca](https://twitter.com/S0Soneca) will receive R$1 via Pix. Adding a little bit of motivation for myself! ðŸ˜‰ (Before requesting anything, be sure to check the time in my timezone first - for me the timezone is GMT-3)

## Inspiration

This challenge was proposed by [@florinpop1705](https://twitter.com/florinpop1705) he started this on 2019. if you want know more to join me
