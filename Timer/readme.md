# Countdown Timer to New Year

**Tier:** 1-Beginner

We all have important events we look forward to in life, birthdays,
anniversaries, and holidays to name a few. Wouldn't it be nice to have an app
that counts down the months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds to an event?
Countdown Timer is just that app!

The objective of Countdown Timer is to provide a continuously decrementing
display of the he months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds to a user entered
event.

### Constraints

- Use only builtin language functions for your calculations rather than relying
on a library or package like [MomentJS](https://momentjs.com/). This assumes,
of course, that the language of your choice has adequate date and time
manipulation functions built in.
- You may not use any code generators such as the 
[Counting Down To](https://countingdownto.com/) site. You should develop your
own original implementation.
