# Wack a mole

**Tier:** 2-Intermediate

A typical Whac-A-Mole machine consists of a waist-level cabinet with a play area and display screen, and a large, soft, black mallet. Five holes in the play area top are filled with small plastic moles, which pop up at random. Points are scored by whacking each mole as it appears. The faster the reaction the higher the score.
