# Tetris

**Tier:** 2-Intermediate

Tetris is primarily composed of a field of play in which pieces of different geometric forms, called "tetriminos", descend from the top of the field.[1] During this descent, the player can move the pieces laterally and rotate them until they touch the bottom of the field or land on a piece that had been placed before it.[2] The player can neither slow down the falling pieces nor stop them, but can accelerate them in most versions
